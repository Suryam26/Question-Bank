Once 'Docker-Daemon' is up and running navigate to the project directory and in the terminal run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

This command will build a docker container using 'Dockerfile' and 'docker-compose.yml' file. It will also install all the project dependencies and start the development server.

After that run the initial migration for the project using the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```
